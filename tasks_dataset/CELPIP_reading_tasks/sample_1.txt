# Email about brochure styles

Hi Maria,

Hope you are well. I just forwarded you the email regarding the three brochure styles.

With regards to the Book Style, while it appeals to us 1. (financially/visuals/content-wise/business-wise), it might cause strains in the time delay due to the overwhelming amount of pages that are to be produced.

On the other hand, the Mac Style might appeal to the younger audience more given 2. (its latest design/the jam-packed information/the visuals and graphics/the lesser pages). I think we should really think about that!

Statistically, however, for businesses, the Landscape Style blows the other two out of the water in terms of 3. (its sales/its effectiveness for businesses/its dominance/a reasonable mix) and we can really leverage that. Not only that, it might also 4. (save us money/give more text/be more detailed/be more underwhelming) when compared with the Book Style. Plus, comparatively, I do feel like it will overcome the 5. (non-vintage design/excessive graphics/number of pages/lack of information) issue that the Mac Style faces.

Curious to know your thoughts!

Best

Charles
