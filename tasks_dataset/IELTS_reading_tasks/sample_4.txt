# Volunteer information
**Volunteers**
Thank you for volunteering to work one-on-one with some of the students at our school who need extra help.

**Smoking policy**

Smoking is prohibited by law in the classrooms and anywhere on the school grounds.

**Safety and Health**

Volunteers are responsible for their own personal safety and should notify the school of any pre-existing medical conditions. Prescription and any other medications that you normally carry with you must be handed in to the school nurse on arrival and collected on departure. If you require them, the nurse will dispense them to you in her office.

**Sign-in**

A sign-in book is located at office reception. Please sign this register every time you come to the school. This is important for insurance purposes and emergency situations.

After signing the book, collect a Visitor’s badge from the office. This must be worn at all times when you are on school premises. Remember to return the badge afterwards.

**Messages**

Teachers will communicate with volunteers via telephone, email or messages left at the office. Always ask for messages. You may communicate with teachers in the same way – the preferred method is to leave a memo in the relevant teacher’s pigeonhole.  These can be found at the end of the corridor in the staffroom block.

**Work hours**

We understand that your time commitment is entirely voluntary and therefore flexible. If your personal schedule should change and this affects your availability, please contact the Co-ordinator for Volunteers at the school on extension 402; alternatively, you could drop in to her office situated in F block.

**Role of the Co-ordinator**

The Co-ordinator is responsible for matching volunteer tutors with students, organising tutorial rooms, ensuring student attendance and overseeing volunteer tutor training. If you encounter any problems, contact her as above.
