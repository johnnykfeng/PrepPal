# Employment conditions

**Conditions of employment**
Weekly hours of work – 40 hours per week at the ordinary hourly rate of pay for most full-time employees, plus reasonable additional hours (penalty rates  apply). Part-time employees work a regular number of hours and days each week, but fewer hours than full-time workers. Casual employees are employed on an hourly or daily basis.

Entitlements (full-time employees):

Parental leave – up to 12 months’ unpaid leave for maternity, paternity and adoption related leave.  

Sick leave – up to 10 days’ paid sick leave per year; more than 4 continuous days requires a medical certificate.

Annual leave – 4 weeks’ paid leave per annum, plus an additional week for shift workers.

 Public holidays – a paid day off on a public holiday, except where reasonably requested to work. Employees working on public holidays are entitled to 15% above their normal hourly rate.

 Notice of termination – 2 weeks’ notice of termination (3 weeks if the employee is more than 55 years old and has at least 2 years of continuous service)

 Note: 

The entitlements you receive will depend on whether you are employed on a full-time, part-time or casual basis.

 If you work part-time, you should receive all the entitlements of a full-time employee but on a pro-rata or proportional basis.

 If you are a casual worker, you do not have rights to any of the above entitlements nor penalty payments. Casual workers have no guarantee of hours to be worked and they do not have to be given advance notice of termination.

1 Penalty rate = a higher rate of pay to compensate for working overtime or outside normal hours e.g. night-time or on public holidays.
